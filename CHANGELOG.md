## 1.1. 2025-08-08

- **Summary of Changes**: Added a new "Risk Management" section (Section 9) to the `docs/specs.md` document.
- **Reason for Changes**: To formally document key risks, including Market Risk, Data Dependency Risk, and Model & Execution Risk, along with their mitigation strategies. This enhances the strategic plan's robustness by explicitly addressing potential failure points.
