### Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Document Name:** `prd.md`

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** August 9, 2025

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the **Weekly Trend-Based Rotational Strategy** application. It expands upon the technical specifications provided in `specs_v2.md` by defining the business objectives, user stories, and acceptance criteria. This PRD will serve as the guiding document for the development team, ensuring that the final application meets both the technical and business needs.

---

### 2. Business Objectives

The primary business objective is to create a fully automated trading application that executes a weekly, trend-based rotational strategy. The application should provide a reliable, low-frequency trading system that can generate consistent returns over the long term by capitalizing on macro-economic trends and momentum shifts in liquid asset classes. Success will be measured by:

-   **Performance**: The strategy's performance relative to a benchmark (e.g., S&P 500) over a 12-month period.
-   **Reliability**: The application's uptime and the accuracy of its trade execution.
-   **Efficiency**: The ability to process data and generate signals within the specified weekly timeframe.

---

### 3. User Stories

The application's users are quantitative traders and portfolio managers. The following user stories capture their key needs:

-   **US-1**: As a portfolio manager, I want to see the weekly trade signals generated by the application so I can approve them before execution.
-   **US-2**: As a trader, I want to have a clear dashboard that displays the current positions, their entry and exit signals, and the performance of the strategy.
-   **US-3**: As a system administrator, I want to receive alerts if a data feed fails or if the application experiences a critical error, so I can respond immediately.
-   **US-4**: As a quantitative analyst, I want to be able to backtest the strategy with different historical data sets to validate its robustness.
-   **US-5**: As a trader, I want to have a weekly chart (over 2-year windows) per instrument that displays when each indicator (per pane) is showing sell signal and buy signal.

### 4. Functional Requirements

The application must implement the technical specifications from `specs_v2.md`. The following are the high-level functional requirements:

-   **FR-1**: The system must be able to ingest and process weekly data for a specified universe of ETFs and spot FX pairs.
-   **FR-2**: The system must calculate the five composite entry signals (MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Candlestick vs. SMA, Trend Force) as defined in `specs_md`.
-   **FR-3**: The system must apply the Relative Strength Gauge macro overlay to rank eligible instruments and determine allocation.
-   **FR-4**: The system must notify potential trades to (buy/sell to) open and/or (buy/sell to) close positions according to the position sizing and layered exit strategy defined in specs_v2.md.
-   **FR-5**: The system must provide a user interface (UI) or reporting mechanism to display the weekly signals, current positions, and performance metrics.
-   **FR-6**: The system must have a robust logging and error-handling system to record all events and failures.

---

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **NFR-1 (Performance)**: The system must complete all data processing and signal generation within 24 hours of the weekly data becoming available.
-   **NFR-2 (Reliability)**: The system must have an uptime of at least 99.9% during trading hours.
-   **NFR-3 (Scalability)**: The architecture should be scalable to handle an expanded asset universe (e.g., from 10 to 100 instruments) without a significant degradation in performance.
-   **NFR-4 (Extensibility)**: The architecture must be extensible to allow for the easy addition of new indicators or a higher frequency of data processing (e.g., from weekly to daily) if required in the future.
-   **NFR-5 (Scalability)**: The architecture should be scalable to handle backend ephemeral and different storage types (eg S3, googledrive, etc) for hosting assets' historical price data.
-   **NFR-6 (Security)**: All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted. The system must use a secure authentication and authorization mechanism.

---

### 6. Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria for each user story and functional requirement will be developed in a subsequent phase, but a high-level example is:

-   **AC for US-1**: The system displays a list of all trade signals for the current week. For each signal, it includes the instrument, the direction (buy/sell), and the reason for the signal (e.g., all five composite signals met). The system allows a user with "approver" privileges to confirm or reject each signal before execution.

---

### 7. Future Scope (Out of Scope for V1.0)

-   Backtesting module with a user-friendly interface.
-   Alerting system for real-time market events.
-   Optimization engine to fine-tune strategy parameters.
